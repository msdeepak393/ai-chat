# Electron - AI Chat

A simple AI chat application made with Electron, Node.js, and the DuckDuckGo API.

Currently we are using the DuckDuckGo API for responses, but you can integrate any AI to manage responses by modifying the code in `main.js` (line 45).

# Why Electron?
We chose Electron for this project because it allowed us to create a cross-platform desktop application with web technologies. Additionally, Electron provides a simple and easy-to-use API for interacting with the file system and other system resources. This made it easy to create a simple chat application with a GUI.
